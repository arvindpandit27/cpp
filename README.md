# CPP
All things C++

# Yet another C++ tutorial - ugh, why?!

Firstly, I apologise. I could not help myself. But in all honesty I can't find exactly what I need out there. Sometimes there's too much code, sometimes a lot of explanation - it's um... very difficult to follow things without really getting into the details. THIS IS A PROBLEM! 
Now is there a solution? Maybe? Maybe no? Let's figure it out! Let's learn C++ ~the right~ my way!

# The problem with the problem

### No single solution
Coding is like um... abstract art. But not as ~illogical~ crazy. There is surely a method to the madness. 99.9% of times, there is no single way to write a piece of code. For me personally, being a novice at coding with intermediate math skills, this is often a very difficlt problem.

### Too long to read
Do I focus on the algorithm? Do I focus on the implementation? A bit of both? I get lost in the details so easily! 

### Lacks humour
Existing C++ docs gets rid of the fun in learning. They are boring and meandering and long and confusing. 


# Contents

This page will contain many basic, intermediate, and hopefully advanced algorithms discussed and implemented in the simplest forms. We will try to nail down the strategy at first, be concise yet elaborate and descriptive, and most importantly be engaging and funny :) 

I end this page with a famous quote which I keep reminding myself to stay on track of an algorithmic implementation / when I play chess. It sort of allows me to introspect my ideas and implementation as I'm writing any piece of code on the go...
