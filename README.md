# CPP
All things C++

# Yet another C++ tutorial - ugh, why?!

Firstly, I apologise. I could not help myself. But in all honesty I can't find exactly what I need out there. Sometimes there's too much code, sometimes a lot of explanation - it's um... very difficult to follow things without really getting into the details. THIS IS A PROBLEM! 
Now is there a solution? Maybe? Maybe no? Let's figure it out! Let's learn C++ ~the right~ my way!

# The problem with the problem

### No single solution
Coding is like um... abstract art. But not as ~illogical~ crazy. There is surely a method to the madness. 99.9% of times, there is no single way to write a piece of code. For me personally, being a novice at coding with intermediate math skills, this is often a very difficlt problem.

### Too long to read
Do I focus on the algorithm? Do I focus on the implementation? A bit of both? I get lost in the details so easily! 

### Lacks humour
Existing C++ docs gets rid of the fun in learning. They are boring and meandering and long and confusing. 

I end this page with a famous quote which I keep reminding myself to stay on track of an algorithmic implementation / when I play chess. It sort of allows me to introspect my ideas and implementation as I'm writing any piece of code on the go...
